## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis tool that uses various machine learning models to analyse social media posts for sentiment. It allows users to input a product or brand name, collects social media data via the Reddit API, and applies sentiment analysis models to determine whether the posts are positive, negative, or neutral.

### Abstract

The rapid expansion of the internet and social media has led to customers increasingly relying on the internet as both a place for discussion and a news source. This has resulted in the need for companies to monitor and understand what is being said on social media about their brand. This project aims to harness natural language processing and deep-learning models to analyse the sentiment of online discourse. The goal is to provide business owners with a comprehensive understanding of the sentiment surrounding their brand, enabling informed decision-making based on a holistic view of online discourse. The artefact's graphical user interface (GUI) provides intuitive access to these insights, facilitating effective monitoring and response to online sentiment.
